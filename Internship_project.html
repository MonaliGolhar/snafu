                   <li>Project group generally contains 3 to 5 people.</li>
                   <li>After choosing domain start searching for your project mates who wants to do project in the same domain.</li>

                       <ol><li>Person who is very serious about project. He plans the flow of project and other people follow him. He is the leader 
of the project.</li>
                           <li>The person having technical ability to work on the particular task and complete it.Generally such kind of people follows the flowchart of project and completes their assigned task.</li>
                           <li>This category contains people who are technically not so strong but can do small tasks.<br> But they can do the other non technical procedures and 
can arrange all the required things. They may help in drafting of the project.</li>
                       </ol>
                   </li>
                   <li>Your group configuration should be like:<br>
                       <br>
                            One person of Type 1
                       <br>
                            Two or three people of type 2
                       <br>
                            Zero or one person of type 3
                   </li>
                   <li>Never have more than one type 1 people in the group.These people are kind of dominating in nature.This may lead to have clashes in group.</li>
                   <li>Have at least two type 2 people.You can manage one type 3 person for your non technical needs. Rather than having two A type guys in a group prefer 
having one type 3 person.</li>
                   <li>In project groups you need to compromise few things.Solve the problems by discussion.Avoid misunderstandings.Maintain the bond between 
group mates.<br>Be a great team! :)</li>
